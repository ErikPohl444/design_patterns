# Design Patterns

This repository demonstrates classic and modern software design patterns, implemented in Python. Each pattern includes example code and explanations to help you understand when and how to use them in real-world applications.

## Patterns Included

- Creational Patterns (Singleton, Factory, Builder, etc.)
- Structural Patterns (Adapter, Decorator, Facade, etc.)
- Behavioral Patterns (Observer, Strategy, Command, etc.)
- Additional modern and Pythonic idioms

## Future plans

- [ ] Add more patterns and idiomatic Python examples
- [ ] Provide real-world scenarios for each pattern
- [ ] Move future plans to issues
- [ ] Add shared resources here

## Important disclaimer

This repository is intended for educational purposes. Explore, use, and adapt the provided examples as you see fit.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository and explore the folders for each design pattern. Each directory contains Python implementations and explanatory documentation or docstrings.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- No external dependencies required for most examples

## Installing

No installation required. Download or clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ErikPohl444/design_patterns.git
```

## Running the tests

If test suites are provided (e.g., in a `tests/` folder), run them using:
```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```
or with `pytest` if available.

## Contributing
